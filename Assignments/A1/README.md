#ðŸ“” Assignment #1

* Find a concept, an idea, or a thought online about a best practice related to web development or software engineering that can be summarized into a statement. Its source can be just be a tweet, or a whole blog post, or from a book, etc.

* Use the statement as a title, then add a description explaining it in your own words, just like how you did in the pre-course's Feyman writing prompts.

* Present this using HTML & CSS on an HTML page.

* Include the link of the source in the HTML page (however you choose to cite it).

* Push your work to a new repo in your Github account, then send me the link in our Slack channel, or here.

* This is your chance to get adventurous and creative so we expect you to immerse yourself in HTML & CSS alongside web development concepts.
